# Sorting and Tree Visualization Tool

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive visualization tool that allows users to explore various sorting algorithms and tree data structures in an interactive manner. It features sorting visualizations for algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort. Each sorting algorithm is animated to illustrate its operation, providing a clear understanding of how the sorting process works.

## Key Features

### Sorting Visualization
- **Merge Sort**: Visualizes the divide-and-conquer approach of merging sorted arrays.
- **Quick Sort**: Demonstrates the partitioning process and the efficiency of the algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort**: Shows how elements are gradually sorted one at a time.
- **Selection Sort**: Illustrates the selection of the minimum element and its placement.
- **Bubble Sort**: Displays how the algorithm repeatedly steps through the list.

### Tree Data Structures
- **AVL Trees**: Create and visualize balanced binary trees with rotations to maintain balance.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Build and traverse BSTs with options for pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Integer Binary Search Trees (iBST)**: Similar to BSTs but specifically for integers.
- **Max/Min Heap Trees**: Visualize the heap properties, showing how elements are organized.

## Educational Value

This tool serves as a valuable resource for students, educators, and developers interested in learning about sorting algorithms and tree data structures. Its interactive features facilitate a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work and their underlying principles.
